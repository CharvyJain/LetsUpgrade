QUESTION : In the Binary Search algorithm, it is suggested to calculate the mid as
beg + (end - beg) / 2 instead of (beg + end) / 2. Why is it so?

ANSWER : When we are operating with a large array with large index values, the addition of (beg + end) may exceed the integer value. By adding 
the half value to beg we can avoid the overflowing of the addition of numbers.
